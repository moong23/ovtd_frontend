i want to make tornament-drafting-website which uses React as Front-end and Node.js as Back-end. In Back-end, i want to use socket-communication to interact with front-end.
The website should have these function.

0. I should have super-account which could give 'Leader' role to users.
1. 10 or more people should be logged in (should not have register since I'm going to give them their id)
2. Two players will be selected as Team A leader and Team B leader by me(which is super-account)
3. Each Leader will pick their position between 1 tank, 2 attack, 2 heal.
4. Website will randomly choose Team A or Team B to start with.
5. The Chosen Team's leader(possibly A) chooses one player with his role.
6. The other Team's leader(B) chooses two players with their roles.
7. Then team leader who chose teammate at step5 (A) chooses 2 players and then the other team chooses 2 players with their roles.
8. the rest one player goes to the first Team(A).

can you make code for these website?
